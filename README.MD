# Seriousuggets (simple blogging website)
* Thanks, the project now is set up as a simple static website so I dont have to deal with database drama. The code that is published and live at ? is the static file version.

*  So far this has been a huge and fun learning experience. By no means is the code in this repository perfect and neither do I advertise this! This website is currently deployed ?

# Nuggetnova (simple blogging website)

* *Dude, there are like a million off the shelf blogging ready templates that you could use man, why even bother with creating a blogging website from scratch?*
  * **I wanted to do something myself and have a deep understanding of its flaws and potential benefits. I have always wanted to build a website using the Nodejs framework. I do realize that there are probably better alternatives for blogging such as Wordpress and others. This is a personal project that I have been wanting to do for a long time.**
* So far this has been a huge and fun learning experience. By no means is the code in this repository perfect and neither do I advertise this! This website is currently deployed https://seriousnuggets.me/


## Nuggetnova is a simple blogging website project developed using Nodejs, express, the vash template engine, PostgreSQL database and now Strapi.io.

* Key components:
  * authentication/login which allows access to the publishing of new blog posts
  * editing, adding, and deleting of published blog posts
  * archive area which allows the quick lookup of past blog posts
  * fully editable about page
  * categorized posts
  * admin area with events, messages and application customizable settings

## Getting Started

* Nuggetnova now uses Strapi.io! It greatly simplfies much of the logic and the pain of publishing new content. Feel free to use this as a good example if you wish to use Strapi as well.


## Prerequisites

* mid to deep level understanding of JavaScript
* basic SQL understanding
* basic MVC concepts/routing

## Future plans

* better user friendliness with publishing new articles
  * Strapi.io accomplishes this!
* better setup and a more templated version for others who wish to use this
  *  Strapi.io accomplishes this! 
* better documentation
* more customizablity for the application settings
